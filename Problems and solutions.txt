Problems and solutions:

1. EC2 Ubuntu Instance - UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE
   UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!  
permissions 0644 for 'xxxxx.pem' are too open.
It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
bad permissions: ignore key: xxxxx.pem
Permission denied (publickey).

Solution: 

Private keys must be readable only by the owner ..
Do chmod 400 xxxxx.pem on the machine from which you're connecting
