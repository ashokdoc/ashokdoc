While on the server, check to make sure sshd is actually running, and is listening on port 22:
$ sudo netstat -anp | grep sshd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1538/sshd       
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1538/sshd    

 sudo iptables -L | grep ssh
DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:ssh

  After detaching a volume from the instance it can attache to other instance
  But make sure that do not format the data while mounting & make sure that mount into a folder path should look like that /mnt/test/ (donâ€™t not use -t) 
  After work done 
  While attaching the same volume to the other instance make sure that you have to give the name as 
  /dev/sda1 (not in case it will not attach as a root device)

to adjust the firewalls we need to use this command

sudo ufw app list

  Nginx Full (both port 80 and 4443)
  Nginx HTTP
