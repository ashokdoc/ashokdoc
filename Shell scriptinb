Shell Script: 
To export a path as system path: 
Ex: if we want to make a path as system path 
      $ export PATH=${PATH}:/home/ec-2user/usercmds/bin
So the default which also look into this folder also, if any script present in the location it will run from command line.
 
But is it temporary if we want make it permeant
Change it in the .bashrc
And then run 
 
 $source .bashrc (it’s a permanent change)

User required text print

 
If we want to print the ls output through echo message then we can use $ echo “(ls)”  
                     $ echo ‘(ls)’
                     $ echo  $ls    ### there is variation in the outputs check the about command.
•	If we use command in the double quotes there is different if we use txt in the double quote there will be different output.



Variables:   


 
 
By default if there is no variable values then it will show blank space. No space while defining the variable value
If we add \n then we get output in different line

Variable shellnot start with number

To print date.log with variable 

$todays_date=$(date +”%Y-%m-%d”)
$log_file_name=$todays_date
$touch ${log_file_name}.log

store the variable into file system,memory.
If you define your variable in the shell script they are ony vaild with in script.
If command line then until computer restart.
It will be permanent in .bashrc or bashprofile
 

The “env” command will display all the variables in the system 

Special variable : echo $? 
If we get the output as 0 last command is successfully some thing else then the last command is error.

Echo command
 
 -n = it will append the next line to it
Ex: my_name=$ashok
echo -n  "your name $my_name"
echo -n "($pwd)"   
echo $(pwd)
output:
observation: when declaring command in echo then don’t use double quote.
-n: it will link the next command output to self line.
\n: basically it will create a new line but if we use in shell 
    Then it will not work.
  

\b: one back move of the cursor
\v: vertical of the text

1.	Input and output commands

echo  output command
read  input command
(command line arguments as a input.)


read -p "some thing" a

2. providing input with command line arguments

vi pvd_in_cm.sh

#read -p "enter num1 :" a
#read -p "enter num2 :" b
result= expr "$a+ $b" |bc
echo "this addition of $a and $b is: $result"

when you run this script it you have to provide the values on the command only.


3.control statements 

for example if we want to run a script that must contain value from command line or from script it self then only the script shell run
it this type of situtions we use command line arguments.

#!/bin/bash
cmd_line_argu=$# (some value should be given)
if [ cmd_line_argu -eq 2 ]
then 
 x=$1
 y=$2
 result=$((x+y))
 echo "value $result"
fi
# here if you dont provide the values from the command line argu then it will not run
 
 Decision Control Statement (Imp)
 
simple shell script to start a apache service
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter the action you want to perform" action
if [ "${action}" == "start" ]
then 
sudo systemctl start apache2
fi
if [ "${action}" == "stop" ]
then 
sudo systemctl stop apache2
fi

4.Loops

when we need to write no of lines again and again then we use loops .

#//bin/bash
for each in $(seq 1 20)
do 
  echo "welcome to shell"
done
# this will print 20 times $echo

different type of loops:
1. for loop
2. while
3. until
4. select  

Generating sequence of number
$seq 1 30  # sysntax seq start end 

select loop:

*it is usefuk when you want to create a numberd menu shell script

loop control commands:

break command is used in script to stop the loop not the entair script

#!/bin/bash
i=1
while true
do 
    echo "$i"
	if [ $1 eq 100 ]
	then 
	break
	fi
i=$((i+1))
done

when the value of i reaches 100 it will automatically terminated.









2.	Awk command

Awk systax
$Awk options ‘pattern/condition {action}’ filename
$command | awk options ‘pattern/condition {action}’
Options:
-F fs to specify a filed separator
-v var=value To declare a variable
-f file To specify a file that contains awk script
$awk –f awk_script.awk filename
$awk ‘BEGIN {print “your file of /etc/passwd”} /root/ {print $0} END {print “file printed”}’ /etc/passwd
BEGIN {
       print "test"
       }
/root/ {
print $0
}
END {
print "test"
}

 

$awk –f awk.script /etc/passwd
Output:  

To initialize a variable and print the variable.
$ awk 'BEGIN { a=5 ; print a }'   # when you write a script no need to provide ; insisted of that you have to provide \n
$echo “2  6” | awk ‘ { print “a=” $1 , “b=” $2 } ’ 
Output : a=2 b=6    # here 2 treated as 1 and 6 treated as 2 as place values 
* By default awk treated your records as fields.
* shebang line for aws script is #!/bin/awk   # use which awk  output
* in awk script no need to write $a symbol in the command it will automatically fetch         the value of a
* Awk’s built-in variables include the field variables $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 is the entire line)

NR= prints all the lines along with line numbers
    $awk 'NR==1{print$2}'








Using awk in shell script: 
  #!/bin/bash
pwd
date
a=$(awk 'BEGIN { print "hai" }’ )
b=$(awk 'BEGIN { print "hai" }' )
echo "value of a=$a"
echo "value of b=$b"

Output:  

 How to read variables for awk script
Some commands usage with awk
 1.	Awk –F ‘:’  ‘{ print $1 }’ /etc/passwd  here : this will work as a separator.
 2.	$cut -d ':' -f /etc/passwd    the above same out put we can getit with cut command : 






4.	Cut Command:
    it will work on based on 1.Byte position
							 2.Character position
							 3.fileds
	systax for cut command
    $cut options <range of byte/character/fileds> file
    options: based on filed -F , based on bytes -b, based on character -c
	Ex: range of poition : 3-7, 3- (till end)
	$ cut -b 1 /etc/passwd   #it wil disply the first letter
	$ cut -b 3- /etc/passwd  # it will dispaly the letter 3 to end
	$ cut -c 2-5 /etc/passwd # it will disply the 2 to 5 character
	$ cut -d -f 2-5 /etc/passwd # it will display the 2 to 5 charachter.  -d means deliminator
	  we can replace the delimeter with desired txt ex: cut -d ':' -f 1,6 --output-delimiter= "=" /etc/passwd # here : will replace = in the output
5. Sed Command: sed opttions commands file name
    Functions of sed commadn on a file: 1. Viewing file content.
										2. Searching 
										3. Find and replace
										4. Insert and delete content
	View file content: 
    -i  it will change the original file  ex: sed -i '1i s.no test' /etc/passwd
	
	
	
    $sed p /etc/passwd # it will print the doc as it is.
	$sed -n 'p' /etc/passwd # it will print without any duplicate value
	$sed -n '/root/p' /etc/passwd # it will search jane in in the document 
	$sed -n -e '/root/p' -e '/root/p' /etc/passwd #used to search multiple values
	$sed -n -f commands.txt /etc/passwd # here all the commands located with in the commads.txt executed with sed
	$sed -n ''2 p' /etc/passwd # it will print only 2nd line (Vertical)
	$sed -n '1,4 p' /etc/passwd # it will print from 1 to 4 lines
	$sed -n '3,$ p' /etc/passwd # it will print 3 to end of the file
	$sed -n '1~2 p ' /etc/passwd # only odd number liines willbe printed 
	$sed -n '/root/,4 p' /etc/passwd # prints first match of root to 4 th line 
	
	
	Delete txt in the file:
	
	$sed '2 d' /etc/passwd # this will delete only 2nd line.
	$sed '1,5 d' /etc/passwd # this will delete 1 to 5 lines.
	$sed '/manager/2 d' /etc/passwd.
	$sed '^$/d' etc/passwd # this will delete the all the empty lines.
	
	Write output to a file
	
	$sed -n '2 output.txt' /etc/passwd # this will write 2 lines as output.
	$sed -n '/root/ w output.txt' /etc/passwd  # this will write root line to to the output
	
	Replace text:
	$sed 's/var/test/' /etc/passwd # it will replace var with test (make sure no space for s)
	$sed  '/1001/s/nagios/test/' /etc/passwd # lines that contains 1001 replace nagios with test
	$echo apple ant |sed -e 's/a/A/' /etc/passwd #  output : Apple ant (captilied the word)
	
    Append a line:
	$sed '$ a test:test:test' /etc/passwd # this will add a line at the end of the document line is : test:test:test
	$sed '2 a test:test:test' /etc/passwd # 3rd line added 
	$sed '1 i test' /etc/passwd # this will insert line before the first line.
	
	insert a line:
    $sed '/nobody/i\ test' /etc/passwd # this will add a line before that matches nobody.
	
	change (to delete and replace)
	$sed '2 c /test/' /etc/passwd # this will delete record on line 2 and adds new reord test.
	$sed '/nobody/c\ test' /etc/passwd # this will replace lines that match nobady with test.
   
	with regex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2tw5yJr5WQ&list=PL2qzCKTbjutJRM7K_hhNyvf8sfGCLklXw&index=36
	special characters: \s \t . * \+ \? and \
	\s : matches for space # this will print all the lines with consistes of space.sed '/s\/p' /etc/passwd
	\ : escape character : the special purpose of any character will be removed. ex: the . special purpose is to look all the files but here it will removed and will look only that matches with .
	\t : matches for tab.
	. : matched any character (it will print the all lines ex p.t, it will print pat pbt pct line all the lines).
	* : matches a sequence of zero of more instaces of matches( sed '/this*/p' etc/passwd here we are applying * to the s word means--> thi this thiss thisss ).
	\? : 
	\+ : same as * but "thi" it will not print.
    ^ (Imp): $sed -n '/^root/p' etc/passwd # here it will print only the word root has to be first word.
	$ :  same as end but the line matches as the end $ sed -n '/root$/p' etc/passwd.
	[]: matches any single charachter in the list. $sed '/ro[ot]t/p' /etc/passwd # it will try to print "root,rott".
	{}: print the number of repitions.
	(): $sed -n '/\(asdf\)\{2\}/p' # it will print the line which matches asdf atleast two times.
